    "# Data Quality Testing with Great Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Data quality is the cornerstone of reliable analytics and trustworthy AI systems. Poor quality data inevitably leads to flawed insights, inaccurate models, and poor decisions. This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to data quality testing using the powerful open-source library, Great Expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Data Quality Matters\n",
    "- **Trust**: High-quality data builds confidence in analytical results and model predictions.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Detecting and fixing data issues early prevents costly downstream problems in ETL pipelines and model training.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensures data reliability over time, leading to more stable and predictable model performance.\n",
    "- **Governance**: Helps meet data governance standards and regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Approach in this Workshop\n",
    "We will use the \"Bike Sharing\" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Throughout this workshop, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Define explicit expectations (rules) about your data.\n",
    "- Systematically validate data against these expectations.\n",
    "- Document data quality results and identify issues using Data Docs.\n",
    "- Understand how to integrate quality checks into data pipelines (conceptually).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of this Workshop\n",
    "- Learn to design meaningful data quality checks applicable to real-world scenarios, such as building the data foundation for a flexible (AI) pricing system.\n",
    "- Gain experience using Great Expectations to define, validate, and visualize expectations and their results over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information\n",
    "We'll be working with a modified version of the UCI Bike Sharing dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset). For simplicity and clarity in this workshop, we've made slight alterations to the columns and denormalized some measures (like temperature) to make them more intuitive."

    "1.  **Column Existence**: Ensure specific columns are present.\n",

    "    gx.expectations.ExpectColumnToExist(column=\"temp\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Set Membership**: Verify that values in a categorical column belong to an allowed set.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Checks if 'weathersit' values are only 1, 2, 3, or 4\n",
    "    gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet(\n",
    "        column=\"weathersit\", \n",
    "        value_set=[1, 2, 3, 4]  # 1:Clear, 2:Cloudy, 3:Light Rain, 4:Heavy Rain\n",
    "    )\n",
