    "## Goal\n",
    "The Goal of this Workshop is gaining hands-on experience in Data Quality assessment, using the Great Expectations Framework. However, the knowledge gained in this Workshop is transferrable to other Testing Frameworks as well. The Data Quality Assessment gives you confidence in the data foundation used in AI."

    "\n",
    "The DataSet was already loaded into the database in this container (database.db). For each set of the exercise, the required data is loaded with a corresponding code cell, so you don't have to worry about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook will lead you through the following scenarios:  \n",
    "- Making basic expectations based on Spring Data of the first year\n",
    "- Checking and refining expectations based on added Summar Data of the first year\n",
    "- Same for Autumn, using increasingly complex Expectations\n",
    "- Same for Winter\n",
    "- Finally using the data from year 2 to verify the expectations, identify datashifts etc.\n",

    "In the end, the goal is to have a solid data foundation to implement a flexible pricing system.\n",
